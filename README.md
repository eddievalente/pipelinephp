# Gesher PTM
## Personal Task Manager in PHP + mySQL

PTM is a small application written in PHP, with a mySQL database, which implements a three-level task manager:

** Pipeline **
Pipeline is the largest group of tasks, where you place actions of the same type.

** Actions **
Actions are steps or areas of the pipeline that group tasks with the same objective.

** Tasks **
It is the tasks themselves, which define what needs to be done.

## Plan

This is my first project, entirely written in PHP. After this, I will be creating the same project for Laravel and React frameworks.

## Structure

The application was configured as MVP ( Model-View-Presenter ). There are some library classes that group together some functions used by other classes.
